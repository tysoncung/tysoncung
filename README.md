## What I'm Building

As CPO at hivo.co, I drive our product strategy while staying hands-on with cloud infrastructure, AI systems, and engineering practices. Making sure our systems scale without falling over is still my favorite part, but building production AI that actually works is a close second. Previously built data platforms at Insurance Commission of WA. B.Sc Computer Science from NUS.

**Day-to-day:**
- Production AI/ML systems and LLM deployments
- AWS infrastructure (the kind that actually stays up)
- Kubernetes orchestration and container platforms
- Real-time data analytics and streaming architectures

## Projects

### Curated Lists I Maintain

- **[awesome-vibe-coding](https://github.com/tysoncung/awesome-vibe-coding)** - AI coding assistants like Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf ⭐ 9 stars
- **[awesome-ai-gadgets](https://github.com/tysoncung/awesome-ai-gadgets)** - AI-powered hardware and gadgets
- **[awesome-n8n](https://github.com/tysoncung/awesome-n8n)** - 380+ workflow automation resources

## What I'm Learning

Deep diving into AI agents and RAG architectures, while exploring Rust for systems programming. Also getting into clinical data standards (FHIR, OMOP) for healthcare AI applications. Always interested in production ML challenges and making Kubernetes less painful.

## Get in Touch

Best way to reach me is through GitHub or LinkedIn. Happy to chat about AI systems, cloud infrastructure, production ML challenges, or that one weird LLM hallucination that only happens in prod.
