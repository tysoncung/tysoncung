## What I'm Building

As CPO at hivo.co, I drive our product strategy while staying hands-on with cloud infrastructure and engineering practices. Making sure our systems scale without falling over is still my favorite part. Previously built data platforms at Insurance Commission of WA. B.Sc Computer Science from NUS.

**Day-to-day:**
- AWS infrastructure (the kind that actually stays up)
- Production ML pipelines and LLM deployments
- Kubernetes orchestration and container platforms
- Real-time data analytics and streaming architectures

## Projects

### Curated Lists I Maintain

- **[awesome-ai-gadgets](https://github.com/tysoncung/awesome-ai-gadgets)** - AI-powered hardware and gadgets (just created today!)
- **[awesome-vibe-coding](https://github.com/tysoncung/awesome-vibe-coding)** - AI coding assistants like Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf
- **[awesome-n8n](https://github.com/tysoncung/awesome-n8n)** - 380+ workflow automation resources
- **[awesome-biostatistics](https://github.com/tysoncung/awesome-biostatistics)** - Clinical trials and medical research tools
- **[awesome-devops-tools](https://github.com/tysoncung/awesome-devops-tools)** - Modern DevOps toolchain (just updated with Q4 2025 tools)
- **[awesome-prompt-engineering](https://github.com/tysoncung/awesome-prompt-engineering)** - LLM prompting techniques

These lists started because I couldn't find good resources when I needed them. Now they help thousands of developers.

**More Lists:** [biostatistics](https://github.com/tysoncung/awesome-biostatistics) | [devops-tools](https://github.com/tysoncung/awesome-devops-tools) | [prompt-engineering](https://github.com/tysoncung/awesome-prompt-engineering) | [ai-agents](https://github.com/tysoncung/awesome-ai-agents)
